###Adapter-Pattern
Adapter pattern works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern combines the capability of two independent interfaces.

This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to join functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces. A real life example could be a case of card reader which acts as an adapter between memory card and a laptop. You plugin the memory card into card reader and card reader into the laptop so that memory card can be read via laptop.

#####Implementation
![adapter]

Headfirst example code see project.

Detail tutorialspoint example code see [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/adapter_pattern.htm)

###Observer-Pattern
Observer pattern is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects such as if one object is modified, its depenedent objects are to be notified automatically. Observer pattern falls under behavioral pattern category.

#####Implementation
![observer]

Headfirst example code see project.

Detail tutorialspoint example code see [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/observer_pattern.htm)

###Decorate-Pattern
Decorator pattern allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern acts as a wrapper to existing class.

This pattern creates a decorator class which wraps the original class and provides additional functionality keeping class methods signature intact.

We are demonstrating the use of decorator pattern via following example in which we will decorate a shape with some color without alter shape class.

#####Implementation
![decorate]

Headfirst example code see project.

Detail tutorialspoint example code see [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/decorator_pattern.htm)

###Factory-Pattern
Factory pattern is one of most used design pattern. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.

In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface.

#####Implementation
![factory]

Headfirst example code see project.

Detail tutorialspoint example code see [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/factory_pattern.htm)

###Abstract-Factory-Pattern
Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other factories. This factory is also called as factory of factories. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.

In Abstract Factory pattern an interface is responsible for creating a factory of related objects without explicitly specifying their classes. Each generated factory can give the objects as per the Factory pattern.

#####Implementation
![abstract-factory]

Headfirst example code see project.

Detail tutorialspoint example code see [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/abstract_factory_pattern.htm)

###Singleton-Pattern
Singleton pattern is one of the simplest design patterns. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.

This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created. This class provides a way to access its only object which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class.

#####Implementation
![singleton]

Headfirst example code see project.

Detail tutorialspoint example code see [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/singleton_pattern.htm)

###Strategy-Pattern
In Strategy pattern, a class behavior or its algorithm can be changed at run time. This type of design pattern comes under behavior pattern.

In Strategy pattern, we create objects which represent various strategies and a context object whose behavior varies as per its strategy object. The strategy object changes the executing algorithm of the context object.

#####Implementation
![strategy]

Headfirst example code see project.

Detail tutorialspoint example code see [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/strategy_pattern.htm)

###Command-Pattern
Command pattern is a data driven design pattern and falls under behavioral pattern category. A request is wrapped under an object as command and passed to invoker object. Invoker object looks for the appropriate object which can handle this command and passes the command to the corresponding object which executes the command.

#####Implementation
![command]

Headfirst example code see project.

Detail tutorialspoint example code see [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/command_pattern.htm)

###Template-Pattern
In Template pattern, an abstract class exposes defined way(s)/template(s) to execute its methods. Its subclasses can override the method implementation as per need but the invocation is to be in the same way as defined by an abstract class. This pattern comes under behavior pattern category.

#####Implementation
![template]

Headfirst example code see project.

Detail tutorialspoint example code see [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm)

###Iterator-Pattern
Iterator pattern is very commonly used design pattern in Java and .Net programming environment. This pattern is used to get a way to access the elements of a collection object in sequential manner without any need to know its underlying representation.

Iterator pattern falls under behavioral pattern category.

#####Implementation
![iterator]

Headfirst example code see project.

Detail tutorialspoint example code see [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/iterator_pattern.htm)

###Composite-Pattern
Composite pattern is used where we need to treat a group of objects in similar way as a single object. Composite pattern composes objects in term of a tree structure to represent part as well as whole hierarchy. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern creates a tree structure of group of objects.

This pattern creates a class that contains group of its own objects. This class provides ways to modify its group of same objects.

Iterator pattern falls under behavioral pattern category.

#####Implementation
![composite]

Headfirst example code see project.

Detail tutorialspoint example code see [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/composite_pattern.htm)

###State-Pattern
In State pattern a class behavior changes based on its state. This type of design pattern comes under behavior pattern.

In State pattern, we create objects which represent various states and a context object whose behavior varies as its state object changes.

#####Implementation
![state]

Headfirst example code see project.

Detail tutorialspoint example code see [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/state_pattern.htm)

###Proxy-Pattern
In proxy pattern, a class represents functionality of another class. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern.

In proxy pattern, we create object having original object to interface its functionality to outer world.

#####Implementation
![proxy]

Headfirst example code see project.

Detail tutorialspoint example code see [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/proxy_pattern.htm)

###Compound-Pattern
In proxy pattern, a class represents functionality of another class. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern.

In proxy pattern, we create object having original object to interface its functionality to outer world.

#####Implementation
![compound]

Headfirst example code see project.
